👋🏻 **Ahoj!**

I humbly present to you my craft 🪄

- 🌱 **Archived repos** of projects that made me the dev I am today
- 🔮 **Side projects**
- 🛠️ **Hobby/fun** little adventures
- 🔓 **Open-source** contributions

**Roots 🪴**

I've done quite a lot of `different` stuff (C# desktop apps, .NET web APIs, Vue.js frontends, GraphQL, ...) - currently looking to expand into some new languages (Go/Rust)

**My experience and skills 🧑🏻‍💻**

I am well established as a `full-stack` web dev but my most recent work is primarily concentrated around `front end` (TypeScript, React, Next.js, Vite, Tailwind, React-query, etc.)

**Current status 🚥**

I contribute as a contractor to big projects on a daily basis - either `adding, fixing or improving` the main project or developing various isolated modules from the scratch or other company standalone software of different sizes that is either for internal use or directly facing the users.

> My contributions are lost in the Boötes Void (company's repo of choice is GitLab) 🌀
